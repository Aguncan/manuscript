## 13 Practical ways of using GitHub in EEB

### Storing a research compendium

<!--*contributors to this section: Dylan Gomes, Emma Hudgins* -->

Many researchers often start their use of GitHub to backup their working code and data to a remote server (Just push and pull, see [Box 1](#definitions), from their own repo).
The GitHub repository serves as an additional backup and also allows the user to synchronize files and work on any computer with internet access.
Because GitHub is built on git, version control features are also available, allowing users to re-visit or even restore previous versions of the repository.
Storing a research compendium as a GitHub repository has additional benefits such as facilitating collaboration, integration with data and code archiving services, and contribution to open science, all discussed in sections below.

Unfortunately, GitHub repositories have file size limits, so they may not be appropriate for synchronizing large data files.
Commits (see [Box 1](#definitions)]) greater than 50 MB receive a warning and commits larger than 100 MB are blocked (@https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github).
Therefore, it is recommended that large datasets are stored only locally or using other cloud services.

### Virtual lab notebook

Lab notebooks have been indispensable tools for keeping track of research methods and laboratory policies [@doi:10.1186/s13321-017-0221-3].
Digital lab notebooks stored in the cloud provide clear benefits given the ease with which documents can be shared with new employees and updated as policy changes or experimental methods are modified [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385].
Increasingly, researchers are leveraging GitHub's underlying version control system to maintain and share digital lab notebooks [@doi:10.1038/538127a].
At least for aspects of a research project that involve writing code, a GitHub repository is a form of a lab notebook; when changes are made to files in a version controlled repository, the author of those changes makes a commit ([Box 1](#definitions)) accompanied by a message describing the changes and the reason for them.
Later, the entire history of commits and their messages are viewable and can be audited similar to a physical lab notebook [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub issues ([Box 1](#definitions)) can be used to prioritize lab objectives and goals, as well as track any status updates.
Some EEB labs have even turned their lab notebooks into shareable websites (<https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book>; <https://github.com/HuckleyLab/how_we_work>) as a centralized location for all lab resources.

### Educational materials

GitHub supports a broad set of mechanisms for hosting educational materials.
The entire process of running a course, workshop, or even just a lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub.
For example, organizing a course could be broken down into: 1) developing the material (i.e., slides, examples, relevant readings, labs, etc.), 2) hosting the course on some online platform for students to access, 3) delivering the content, 4) accepting student work submissions and 5) returning graded material.
While there are other purpose-built platforms for this, GitHub provides a free, open-source alternative.

GitHub's open nature allows colleagues to see, review and offer feedback on your process.
Making presentations can be done through most major high-level programming languages such as R, with `RMarkdown` [@isbn:9781138359338], Python, with `python-ppt` (<https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io>), and Julia, with `Remark.jl` (<https://juliapackages.com/p/remark>).
Since all these programs work via code bases, they can be version-controlled through git and GitHub.
Once content is made, hosting a course website can be done through GitHub Pages, and there are lots of templates available (e.g., see <https://github.com/topics/course-website>).
This way, not only can the course content be available to enrolled students, but also to a global pool of learners and teachers interested in the course material.
Content can then be delivered via the course website, and/or a GitHub organization with, for example, template repositories for assignments.
Student submissions are perhaps the most challenging component, but for assignments submitted as code files (i.e., `.R` & `.Rmd` as two of the most common) and/or `.pdf` files, GitHub has a new tool in development - GitHub classroom (<https://classroom.github.com>) - where instructors can host private assignments, and even build custom autograding tests.

While most instructors can feasibly only incorporate some of these tools to deliver their content to students, it is still valuable to do so and to encourage students to begin learning about version control through interacting with git/GitHub, however minimally, through the course.\
Especially if a central tenet of a given course or educational unit is to introduce or give students experience with version control and the tools that working professionals in EEB use, then adopting a few of these tools can be a great way to do so.
