## 13 Practical ways of using GitHub in EEB

### Storing a research compendium
<!--*contributors to this section: Dylan Gomes, Emma Hudgins* -->
Many researchers often start their use of GitHub to backup their working code and data to a remote server (Just push and pull, see [Box 1](#definitions), from their own repo). 
The GitHub repository serves as an additional backup and also allows the user to synchronize files and work on any computer with internet access. 
Because GitHub is built on git, version control features are also available, allowing users to re-visit or even restore previous versions of the repository.

Although it is not recommended to use GitHub for long term data archiving, GitHub integrates with Zenodo, a CERN-funded long-term data archiving service. Zenodo can be linked to your GitHub account and archival activated for any public repository. Then, every time a release ([Box 1](#definitions)) is made, a snapshot of the entire repository is archived in Zenodo with a versioned, citable DOI that can be mentioned in a Data Availability Statement (see 'Making code citable' below for further discussion).
Unfortunately, both GitHub and Zenodo have file size limits. 
GitHub is not recommended for storing large files and thus, commits (see [Box 1](#definitions)]) greater than 50 MB receive a warning and commits larger than 100 MB are blocked (@https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github). 
Therefore, it is recommended that large datasets are stored externally, with services such as Zenodo or other data repositories. 
These services may have their own file storage limits (e.g. Zenodo has a limit of 50GB per dataset) but allow users to upload multiple datasets, and often offer additional storage services for large datasets with an associated cost (@https://git-lfs.github.com, @https://help.zenodo.org).

### Virtual lab notebook
<!--*contributors to this section: RCO* -->
Lab notebooks have been indispensible tools for keeping track of research methods and laboratory policies [@doi:10.1186/s13321-017-0221-3].
Digital lab notebooks stored in the cloud provide clear benefits given the ease with which documents can be shared with new employees and updated as policy changes or experimental methods are modified [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385].
Increasingly, researchers are leveraging GitHub's underlying version control system to maintain and share digital lab notebooks [@doi:10.1038/538127a].
At least for aspects of a research project that involve writing code, a GitHub repository is a form of a lab notebook; when changes are made to files in a version controlled repository, the author of those changes makes a commit ([Box 1](#definitions)) accompanied by a message describing the changes and the reason for them. Later, the entire history of commits and their messages are viewable and can be audited similar to a physical lab notebook [@doi.org/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub issues ([Box 1](#definitions)) can be used to prioritize lab objectives and goals, as well as track any status updates.
Some EEB labs have even turned their lab notebooks into shareable websites (https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book; https://github.com/HuckleyLab/how_we_work) as a centralized location for all lab resources.

### Project management

Modern EEB research is highly collaborative, bringing together multidisciplinary teams from various institutions.
On GitHub, collaborators can share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems (Figure @fig:github-diagram).
GitHub has an "Issues" feature that allows for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels. 
The new GitHub "Discussion" feature serves as a message board for conversation.
Scripts, commit messages, and pull requests can be linked directly to issues and discussions, providing a clear record of project workflow.
The use of GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than e-mail or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project.
Unlike emails and messages which can get lost as more new tasks arise, GitHub issues are intentionally closed by repository administrators hiding the issue from view (closed issues remain accessible but not immediately visible).
Fortunately, it is not essential for all team members to have proficiency in git or programming, as users can interact with Issues and Discussions via web browser or e-mail (e-mail responses still get tracked as comments on the focal GitHub issue).
For larger projects with many team members and tens or hundreds of GitHub issues to sort through, project management software like ZenHub, can help prioritize issues and pull requests. 
ZenHub's web interface includes a GitHub Issue visualizer where users can organize issues into high priority or backlogged tasks and link issues together when they are related to a shared project goal or milestone.
GitHub is currently beta testing a similar project management feature called GitHub Projects [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects]. GitHub can also be integrated with other project management software such as Slack (https://slack.github.com/) so that teams are notified through a Slack group chat when updates are made to a repository.

### Educational materials
<!-- *contributors to this section: Cole Brookson* -->

GitHub supports a broad set of mechanisms for hosting educational materials.
The entire process of running a course, workshop, or even just a lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub.
For example, organizing a course could be broken down into: 1) developing the material (i.e., slides, examples, relevant readings, labs, etc.), 2) hosting the course on some online platform for students to access, 3) delivering the content, 4) accepting student work submissions and 5) returning graded material.
While there are other purpose-built platforms for this, GitHub provides a free, open-source alternative.

GitHub's open nature allows colleagues to see, review and offer feedback on your process.
Making presentations can be done through most major high-level programming languages such as R, with `RMarkdown` [@isbn:9781138359338], Python, with `python-ppt` (https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io), and Julia, with `Remark.jl` (https://juliapackages.com/p/remark).
Since all these programs work via code bases, they can be version-controlled through git and GitHub.
Once content is made, hosting a course website can be done through GitHub Pages, and there are lots of templates available (e.g., see https://github.com/topics/course-website).
This way, not only can the course content be available to enrolled students, but also to a global pool of learners and teachers interested in the course material.
Content can then be delivered via the course website, and/or a GitHub organization with, for example, template repositories for assignments.
Student submissions are perhaps the most challenging component, but for assignments submitted as code files (i.e., `.R` & `.Rmd` as two of the most common) and/or `.pdf` files, GitHub has a new tool in development  - GitHub classroom (https://classroom.github.com) - where instructors can host private assignments, and even build custom autograding tests.
 
While most instructors can feasibly only incorporate some of these tools to deliver their content to students, it is still valuable to do so and to encourage students to begin learning about version control through interacting with git/GitHub, however minimally, through the course.  
Especially if a central tenet of a given course or educational unit is to introduce or give students experience with version control and the tools that working professionals in EEB use, then adopting a few of these tools can be a great way to do so.
