## Thirteen practical ways GitHub can accelerate research in ecology and evolution

### Storing and sharing research compendia

<!--*contributors to this section: Dylan Gomes, Emma Hudgins, Pedro Braga, Katherine HÃ©bert* -->
An EEB research compendium includes all computational materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses and protocols.
Having copies of these files safely stored is essential to protect against accidental modifications or deletions.
Many researchers begin using GitHub to store (or backup) their research compendium [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986] to a centralized, readily-available remote server (see [Box 1](#definitions)).
A centralized research compendium stored in a version-controlled repository has the advantages of facilitating collaboration, integrating data and code archiving services, allowing file versions to be accessed and restored, and contributes to open science (see sections below).
While some EEB researchers may prefer to store their code in Google Drive or DropBox, the process of sharing code through these services becomes cumbersome when collaborators have to download and re-upload edited code.
On GitHub, code is by default public, and the process of forking and submitting pull requests (see [Box 1](#definitions)) ensures a code owner has full control over code and documents in a repository.
The ability to make a GitHub repository private is particularly advantageous for storing materials without necessarily sacrificing privacy, which may be preferred or even essential for certain compendia.
Researchers can then grant specific collaborators read and/or write access to private repositories to pursue pre-publication analyses or writing in privacy, or even to collaborate on research that will permanently remain private.

GitHub limits committed file sizes to 100 Mb (megabytes) [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github], which can may require external file storage alternatives (such as local or cloud-hosting) for some parts of research compendia.
However, with some additional setup, users can still track versions of these external files in their repositories using Git Large File Storage (<https://git-lfs.github.com>).

### Virtual laboratory notebooks

Laboratory notebooks help researchers track their research notes, methods, policies and protocols [@doi:10.1186/s13321-017-0221-3].
Virtual laboratory notebooks can be stored on GitHub and provide the benefits of simultaneous, centralized and selective access, and allows for the easy update of policies and experiment protocols [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385].
Researchers have been increasingly using GitHub to maintain versions and share digital laboratory notebooks across many fields [@doi:10.1038/538127a], including applied ecology (_e.g._, <https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book>), biogeography and global change biology (_e.g._, <https://github.com/HuckleyLab/how_we_work>), and microbial ecology (_e.g._, <https://github.com/CarBBAS/uqam-guide>).

At least for aspects of a research project that involve writing code, a GitHub repository is a form of a laboratory notebook; when changes are made to files in a version-controlled repository, the author of those changes makes a commit ([Box 1](#definitions)) accompanied by a description of changes.
Later, the entire history of commits and their commit messages are viewable and can be audited similar to a physical laboratory notebook [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub issues (see Project management section below) can be used to prioritize laboratory objectives and goals, as well as track any progress updates.

### Project management

Modern research in ecology and evolution is highly collaborative, bringing together multidisciplinary teams from various institutions [@doi:10.1890/120370].
On GitHub, collaborators can share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems (Figure @fig:github-diagram).
Project management can happen via three GitHub repository features: "Issues", "Discussion" and "Projects" ([Box 1](#definitions)).
Github Issues allow for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels.
Github Discussions serve as a message board for conversation.
Finally, GitHub Projects provides users with real-time tracking of project priorities and status [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects].
For instance, one can create a discussion on a project repository to decide which method to apply for biodiversity data analysis.
Then, an issue can be created to establish steps and responsibilities including data formatting, statistical analyses, figure generation, and issue resolution [_e.g._, see issues and discussions in the sPlotOpen manuscript repository, @doi:10.1111/geb.13346]; @url:https://github.com/fmsabatini/sPlotOpen_Manuscript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed].
Using GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than email or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project. 
However, one can opt to receive new issues, discussions, and responses as emails and can post replies by email as well.  
This allows for centralized communication for a team even when some members prefer to use email for communication.
Unlike emails and messages which can get lost as more new tasks arise, GitHub issues are intentionally closed by repository administrators hiding the issue from view (closed issues remain accessible but not immediately visible).

### Educational materials

<!-- *contributors to this section: Cole Brookson* -->

GitHub supports a broad set of mechanisms for hosting educational materials.
The entire process of running a course, workshop, or lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub including material development, web hosting, and delivery, and even submission and grading of assignments.
While there are other purpose-built platforms for this, GitHub provides a free, open-source alternative.

Syllabi, presentations, and other course materials can be version-controlled and stored in GitHub. 
Although plain text formats such as markdown or HTML work best with GitHub and help to keep the total size of the repository within limits, any file type can be stored on and downloaded from GitHub including PowerPoint and Word documents.
Content can then be delivered by sharing a link to the GitHub repository or creating a template repository with assignments that students can use.
Using GitHub to host a course website is also an option for making course content more widely and easily accessible (see [Hosting a Website](#hosting-a-website)).

Using GitHub to collect student submissions is more advanced, but the new GitHub Classroom tool (<https://classroom.github.com>) allows instructors to host private assignments to be submitted collaboratively or individually as code or PDF files, and even build auto-grading tests.
Using GitHub for course management may take an additional time investment compared to traditional tools, but integrating version control and GitHub into course content can boost students' feelings of self-efficacy and confidence [@doi:10.1187/cbe.13-12-0241]. <!-- connection to this ref is tenuous.
