![A summary of ways GitHub can be used showing the difficulty and degree of collaborativity for each. The vertical axis represents technical difficulty such that activities higher on the scale require knowledge and use of more GitHub features than activities lower on the scale.  Each activity spans a region of the horizontal axis representing who is involved with or benefits from each activity.
