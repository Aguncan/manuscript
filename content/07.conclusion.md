## Conclusion  
We provide 12 practical ways that ecologists and evolutionary biologists can incorporate GitHub into their research workflows, and include definitions ([Box 1](#definitions)) and user groups (Figure @fig:github-diagram) to help researchers prioritize which GitHub skills to learn first.
Some GitHub uses are highly collaborative (_e.g._, open science discussion and collaborative code editing) while others are focused on individual actions (_e.g._, storing code/data, building a website).
Regardless of the degree of collaboration, GitHub use in EEB has the potential to make the field more open and transparent than ever before.
Our paper provides the most comprehensive review of how EEB researchers can use GitHub to date, and we encourage researchers at any career stage studying any topic to try GitHub as a platform for sharing and collaboration.
