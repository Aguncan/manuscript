## Conclusion

We describe thirteen practical ways that ecologists and evolutionary biologists can adopt GitHub to improve their research workflow and make it more open and reproducible.
We provide definitions ([Box 1](#definitions)) and types of users (Figure @fig:github-diagram) to help researchers identify and prioritize the skills and tools to learn and apply.
We highlight tools providing high collaborative potential (_e.g._, open science discussion, collaborative code editing) to more individual focused (_e.g._, storing code and data, building a website).
We argue that the tools readily available in GitHub have the potential to make ecology and evolution more open, reproducible and transparent.
With this comprehensive review of how EEB researchers can use GitHub, we encourage researchers at any career stage to adopt GitHub as a platform for sharing and collaboration.
