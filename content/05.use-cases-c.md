### Open science discussion

Research papers are condensed outputs that hide the underlying intellectual and computational workflows, including the treatment of the raw data and analytical steps.
Granting readers access to code and other documentation of the analysis allows them to retrace and comprehend analytical decisions.
GitHub provides a platform to access all aspects of a research project, and can be linked to platforms that create citable DOIs, rather than just the final manuscript.
While often thought of as storage for data and code, GitHub repositories can also be used to publish a time-stamped preregistration of research plans and hypotheses.

Conventional research practices typically rely on one or two people running and checking the data analyses, while most coauthors (and readers of the subsequent publication) see only the final results and a verbal description of the analytical steps.
In the developmental stages, collaborators can directly see the code for the analysis, manipulate and explore the data themselves, and check for errors.
Cynically, there is also more insurance against nefarious colleagues that may be tempted to distort results [@url:https://ecologyforthemasses.com/2020/02/04/pruittdata-and-the-ethics-of-data-in-science].
Collaborators as well as pre-publication and post-publication reviewers are better positioned to discover questionable findings if they have full and transparent access to the project.

This transparency can similarly be extended beyond coauthors to the entire scientific community.
Publishing the data and reproducible workflows along with the manuscript allows any reader to review the analysis and reproduce the experiment [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000763].
Supplying code for (novel) methods that are proposed or used also reduces barriers to knowledge and can greatly improve the ability of others to build on existing work, resulting in greater proliferation and accessibility for a broader audience.
GitHub even provides a useful Discussions Forum (<https://docs.github.com/en/discussions>) that aids the direct communication with repository owners, as well as the GitHub Community (<https://github.community/>) forum for more general questions and sharing of expertise ([Table 1](#tbl:roles).

### Project continuity

<!--*Contributors to this section: BPME, VF*  -->

The development of research code continues, and so does the need to consider project continuity, especially in EEB where graduate students, research assistants, and postdoctoral fellows often hold relatively short-term positions [@doi:10.5334/jors.307].
Often with these types of short-term research projects, once the contract expires, the research code upkeep tends to fall off as the researchers move on to new projects.
Additionally, if the code is kept on only the researcher's personal devices, it becomes increasingly difficult to access the code for future uses.
As projects or contracts end, there should be a handover period of this code in order for the next cohort of researchers to reuse what was already developed [@doi:10.5334/jors.307; @doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].

GitHub facilitates project continuity among research code by providing tools that make this handover period easier. 
As we have already mentioned, using Git for code in Ecology and Evolution can allow for a "paper trail" of sorts to be created for the code, thus allowing for future users of the code access to the entire history of the project [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160]. 
Additionally, GitHub allows for repositories and organizations to have designated Code Owners [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners]; these code owners can change through time allowing for the transition of code from one cohort of researchers to the next [@doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1].
There are also multiple means by which to archive code dependency information with GitHub.
Dependencies can be described in README files, added to environment.yml and/or an environment.txt file, or stored in a repository using tools such as renv (<https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html>).
This ensures that as packages continue to develop with new syntax, code will still run as it did when it was developed.

Within EEB projects, tasks are often divided among contributors taking various roles (see CRediT taxonomy, <https://casrai.org/credit/>).
The creation of project repositories is commonly the purview of those involved in the code, formal analysis, and/or visualization components of the project through their roles as code writers.
However, the structural components of a typical GitHub repository and the derived EEB-specific templates can provide functional ways for other collaborators not contributing to code to be engaged in aspects of repository design in a way that improves institutional memory and facilitates project continuity.
These other collaborators can offer many contributions to repository design and development, and their active involvement can both aid authors ability to act as guarantors of the project, and the clarity and reproducibility of the project for future users.
In (Figure @fig:scatterblob), we highlight several elements of good repository structure, and the various ways that contributors may interact with them. 

### GitHub Organizations

<!--*Contributors to this section: Katherine Hébert, Cole Brookson, PHPB*-->

GitHub Organizations shared virtual spaces that allow teams to work in different repositories, while remaining tied together under a larger figurehead, such as a laboratory, a department, an organization, or a large project involving several teams.
Organizations are well-suited to ensure larger projects with many steps or moving parts are constrained to one virtual space, where outputs and sub-projects can be easily accessed and located without relying on any one individual.
Because the repositories are grouped in one virtual space, members can reference and contribute to each other's work without necessarily being part of the same repository, broadening the accessibility and longevity of code and writing contributions. 

Contributors can be assembled into teams within an organization, which allows administrators to assign roles, tasks and repository modification permissions to organization members.
Whereas access to repositories is usually assigned to individual contributors, Organizations facilitate the management of access permissions by allowing teams to be granted access to specific repositories.
This ensures repositories with sensitive information remain as restricted as needed, while repositories with general stay easily accessible to selected member groups.
The organization structure also allows for easy tracking of issues, projects, and discussions related to research content and progress.

As an example, GitHub Organizations are particularly well-suited to house documents and projects within a laboratory, such as research compendia, codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, and other such documents that evolve collaboratively over time and are relevant to many colleagues. 
In this way, teams can have full ownership of repositories within an organization, while ensuring that these materials stay accessible to the laboratory after people have moved on or lost their copies of project data. 
This application extends to research centres, which may include several distinct projects that remain linked to institutions, such as the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv, <https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity>).
The utility of this tool goes beyond laboratories, being useful to structure the organization, presentation, and outcomes of working groups, such as the hackathon which inspired this paper (SORTEE-Github-Hackathon, <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon>) by keeping track of all materials as ideas develop and take shape in one virtual space.
Organizations are also convenient for hosting learning materials, including lectures or workshops, such as the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science R Workshop Series (QCBSRworkshops, <https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops>) or the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club (Coding Club, <https://github.com/ourcodingclub>), which may be updated by an ever-evolving group of contributors over time.
