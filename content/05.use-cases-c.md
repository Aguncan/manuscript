### Open science discussion

Scientific publications often omit part of their intellectual and computational workflows, including from the treatment of raw data and analytical steps (_e.g._, model assumption testing).
Publishing the data and reproducible workflows along with manuscripts can provide readers with all details on the analysis and reproduce research experiments and results [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000763].
In addition to storing data and code, GitHub repositories can provide a time-stamped (version control) preregistration of research plans and hypotheses.

Conventional research practices typically separate tasks among collaborators (_i.e._, data entering, analyses, writing).
It is not rare that coauthors discuss, but do not actively verify, edit or execute research tasks that are not their main responsibility.
GitHub can serve as a tool for open, trackable research development, where collaborators can directly interact with code and data, and inspect for errors and potential scientific misconduct prior to submission (_e.g._, [@url:https://ecologyforthemasses.com/2020/02/04/pruittdata-and-the-ethics-of-data-in-science]).
Collaborators and readers are better positioned to discover erroneous or questionable findings if they have complete and transparent access to projects.

This transparency can be extended beyond coauthors to the entire scientific community and to the public.
Supplying code for (novel) methods that are proposed or used reduces barriers to knowledge, improving the ability of others to build on existing work.
This results in greater proliferation and accessibility for a broader audience.
Projects can make use of the GitHub Discussions (<https://docs.github.com/en/discussions>) feature to allow for the communication among repository members (collaborators) and to engage with other scientists and the general public. 
Moreover, researches can also use the GitHub Community (<https://github.community/>) forum to share expertise or request help from other researchers in ecology and evolution on their analyses and ideas ([Table 1](#tbl:roles).

### Project continuity

<!--*Contributors to this section: BPME, VF, PHPB  -->

Projects in ecology and evolution often extend beyond the residence of graduate students, research assistants and post-doctoral fellows, who hold limited-term positions [@doi:10.5334/jors.307].
Without clear plans on project continuitiy, the research code and data management upkeep tends to fall off as researchers move on to new projects or to other institutions.
Additionally, code and data can be difficult to access when kept only on the personal devices of researchers.

On one hand, GitHub can facilitate project continuity among research code by making code handover to succeding researchers easier [see @doi:10.5334/jors.307; @doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7]. 
Through its version control, the history of code and data from projects in ecology and evolution can be tracked and be accessible to future laboratory members and collaborators [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160].
Repositories and organizations can have designated data and code owners [or more appropriate, stewards; see @doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1] [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners], who can also can change through time allowing for the transition of code from one cohort of researchers to the next.

On the other hand, GitHub allows for informantion and dependencies on software version backwards compatibility to be described and store, to ensure that code will appropriately run as it did when it was developed.
This can be achieved through the access of GitHub repositories containing the necessary releases of such software, or through the usage of runners and actions with specific software versions in its automation tool, GitHub Actions.

The creation of project repositories is commonly the purview of those involved in the code, formal analysis, and/or visualization components of the project through their roles as code writers.
However, the structural components of a typical GitHub repository and the derived EEB-specific templates can provide functional ways for other collaborators not contributing to code to be engaged in aspects of repository design in a way that improves institutional memory and facilitates project continuity.
These other collaborators can offer many contributions to repository design and development, and their active involvement can both aid authors ability to act as guarantors of the project, and the clarity and reproducibility of the project for future users.
In (Figure @fig:scatterblob), we highlight several elements of good repository structure, and the various ways that contributors may interact with them. 

### GitHub Organizations

<!--*Contributors to this section: Katherine Hébert, Cole Brookson, PHPB*-->

GitHub Organizations shared virtual spaces that allow teams to work in different repositories, while remaining tied together under a larger figurehead, such as a laboratory, a department, an organization, or a large project involving several teams.
Organizations are well-suited to ensure larger projects with many steps or moving parts are constrained to one virtual space, where outputs and sub-projects can be easily accessed and located without relying on any one individual.
Because the repositories are grouped in one virtual space, members can reference and contribute to each other's work without necessarily being part of the same repository, broadening the accessibility and longevity of code and writing contributions. 

Contributors can be assembled into teams within an organization, which allows administrators to assign roles, tasks and repository modification permissions to organization members.
Whereas access to repositories is usually assigned to individual contributors, Organizations facilitate the management of access permissions by allowing teams to be granted access to specific repositories.
This ensures repositories with sensitive information remain as restricted as needed, while repositories with general stay easily accessible to selected member groups.
The organization structure also allows for easy tracking of issues, projects, and discussions related to research content and progress.

As an example, GitHub Organizations are particularly well-suited to house documents and projects within a laboratory, such as research compendia, codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, and other such documents that evolve collaboratively over time and are relevant to many colleagues. 
In this way, teams can have full ownership of repositories within an organization, while ensuring that these materials stay accessible to the laboratory after people have moved on or lost their copies of project data. 
This application extends to research centres, which may include several distinct projects that remain linked to institutions, such as the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv, <https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity>).
The utility of this tool goes beyond laboratories, being useful to structure the organization, presentation, and outcomes of working groups, such as the hackathon which inspired this paper (SORTEE-Github-Hackathon, <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon>) by keeping track of all materials as ideas develop and take shape in one virtual space.
Organizations are also convenient for hosting learning materials, including lectures or workshops, such as the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science R Workshop Series (QCBSRworkshops, <https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops>) or the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club (Coding Club, <https://github.com/ourcodingclub>), which may be updated by an ever-evolving group of contributors over time.
