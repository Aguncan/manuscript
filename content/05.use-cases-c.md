### Open science discussion

Scientific publications often omit part of their intellectual and computational workflows, including the treatment of raw data and analytical steps (_e.g._, model assumption testing).
Publishing data and reproducible workflows along with manuscripts can provide readers with all details about analytical steps and enable reproducing research experiments and results [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000763].
In addition to storing data and code, GitHub repositories can provide a time-stamped (version controlled) preregistration of research plans and hypotheses.

Conventional research practices typically separate tasks among collaborators (_i.e._, data entry, analysis, writing).
It is common that coauthors discuss, but do not actively verify, edit, or execute research tasks that are not their main responsibility.
GitHub can serve as a tool for open and tractable research development. 
Collaborators can directly interact with code and data, inspect for errors, and potentially identify scientific misconduct prior to manuscript submission (_e.g._, [@url:https://ecologyforthemasses.com/2020/02/04/pruittdata-and-the-ethics-of-data-in-science]).
Collaborators and readers are better positioned to discover erroneous or questionable findings if they have complete and transparent access to projects.

This transparency can be extended beyond co-authors to the entire scientific community and to the public.
Supplying code for (novel) methods that are proposed or used reduces barriers to knowledge, improving the ability of others to build on existing work.
This results in greater proliferation and accessibility for a broader audience.
Projects can make use of GitHub Discussions (<https://docs.github.com/en/discussions>) to communicate among repository members (collaborators) and to engage with other scientists and the general public.
Moreover, researchers can also use the GitHub Community (<https://github.community/>) forum to share expertise or request help from others on their analyses and ideas ([Table 2](#tbl:roles)).

### Project continuity

<!--*Contributors to this section: BPME, VF, PHPB  -->

Projects in ecology and evolution often involve graduate students, research assistants, and post-doctoral fellows, who hold limited-term positions [@doi:10.5334/jors.307].
Without clear plans on project continuity, the research code and data management upkeep tends to fall off as researchers move on to new projects or to other institutions.
Additionally, code and data can be difficult to access when kept only on personal devices [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2013.11.014].

GitHub can facilitate project continuity among research code by making code handover easier [@doi:10.5334/jors.307; @doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7]. 
Through version control, the history of code and data from projects in ecology and evolution can be tracked accessible to future laboratory members and collaborators [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160].
Repositories and organizations can have designated data and code owners (or more appropriate, stewards; see [@doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1], [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners]), who can also can change through time allowing for the transition of code between research cohorts.
Other project collaborators can contribute to repository design and development, and their active involvement can both aid authors ability to act as guarantors of the project, and the clarity and reproducibility of the project for future users.
In (Figure @fig:github-diagram), we highlight several elements of good repository structure, and the various ways that contributors may interact with them.

GitHub also allows users to describe and store information about software and code dependencies, ensuring that code can run using the same version of software as when it was initially developed.
This can be achieved through the access of GitHub repositories containing the necessary releases of such software, or through the use of automated Github Actions with specific software versions.

### Automation

<!--*Contributors to this section: PHPB -->

Automation has a strong potential to expand the scale and pace of research in ecology and evolution [@doi:10.1126/science.abi4692].
Automation frameworks can be applied from the collection, analysis, scrutiny, to the integration and deployment of data and code in EEB research.
In this context, small modifications to code and data can be frequently committed and automatically tested (as in continuous integration and continuous deployment practices), allowing for the early detection and correction of errors [@doi:10.1109/MS.2014.58], ultimately mitigating the erosion of confidence in scientific development due to software errors [see @doi:10.12688/f1000research.5930.2].
In addition to increasing scientific rigor and confidence in ecological software [@doi:10.1890/080141], can help advance in the public dissemination and quality of ecological data [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1710231115].
Integrating automation workflows has been highly encouraged in areas of EEB, including predictive ecology [@doi:10.1111/ele.13994], long-term ecological studies [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000125], and management of species at risk information [@doi:10.1038/s41597-022-01381-8].

Automation can be integrated into GitHub repositories through the GitHub Actions feature [@url:https://github.com/features/actions], or through alternative automation systems (_e.g._, Circle CI[@url:https://circleci.com], Travis CI[@url:https://www.travis-ci.com]).
Users can set up workflows associated with their repositories that are triggered by events (_e.g._, push, pull request, or at specified times) for remote servers (runners) to perform user-specified steps and actions.
These actions are highly configurable and have numerous applications, such as automatically running analyses and creating figures when data or code are updated, incorporating changes to websites or applications, testing modifications to software (_e.g._, R or Python libraries).
Action workflows can be found in GitHub's Marketplace (https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) or, alternatively, in open user repositories.

### GitHub Organizations

<!--*Contributors to this section: Katherine Hébert, Cole Brookson, PHPB*-->

GitHub Organizations are shared virtual spaces that allow teams to work in different repositories, while remaining tied together under a larger group, such as a laboratory, department, or project involving several teams.
Organizations are well-suited to ensure larger projects with many steps or moving parts are constrained to one virtual space, where outputs and sub-projects can be easily accessed and located without relying on any one individual.
Because the repositories are grouped, members can reference and contribute to each other's work without necessarily being part of the same repository, broadening the accessibility and longevity of code and writing contributions. 

Contributors can be assembled into teams within an organization, which allows administrators to assign roles, tasks, and repository modification permissions to organization members.
Whereas access to repositories is usually assigned to individual contributors, Organizations facilitate the management of access permissions by allowing teams to be granted access to specific repositories.
This ensures repositories with sensitive information remain as restricted as needed, while others stay open and accessible to selected member groups.
The organization structure also allows for issue tracking and discussions related to research content and progress.

As an example, GitHub Organizations are particularly well-suited to host documents and projects within a laboratory, such as research compendia, codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, and other relevant documents that evolve collaboratively over time. 
In this way, teams have full ownership of repositories within an organization, while ensuring that these materials stay accessible to the laboratory after people have moved on or when locally-stored data are lost.
This application extends to research centres, which may include several distinct projects that remain linked to institutions [_e.g._, the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv, <https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity>)].
The team organizing the hackathon which inspired this article used a GitHub Organization (SORTEE-Github-Hackathon, <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon>) to centralize the project development, from meeting notes to, ultimately, this manuscript.
Organizations are also convenient for hosting learning materials, including lectures or workshops, such as the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science R Workshop Series (QCBSRworkshops, <https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops>) or the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club (Coding Club, <https://github.com/ourcodingclub>), which may be continously updated by an ever-evolving group of contributors.
