Most scientists, including ecologists and evolutionary biologists, are increasingly dependent on computational tools in their research [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Researchers write and use software packages or data analysis code (hereafter, code) to perform scientific tasks ranging from data management, data analysis, and study replication, to the application and the development of tools for hypothesis testing.
Maintaining code for scientific collaboration requires an efficient and well-documented work-flow [@doi:10.1038/d41586-020-02462-7].
To facilitate this process, scientists have been adopting tools from information and systems technology, such as cloud-based services for documentation and version control (_e.g._, from the Google Suite, the Microsoft Suite, and GitHub [@doi:10.1038/538127a]).
However, most researchers lack exposure to adequate code practices and thus dedicate valuable time and effort to self-teaching research-facilitating tools.
Thus, researchers may not adhere to standards of code quality and maintenance [@doi:10.1145/2063348.2063374; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745; @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Here, we review and discuss one of the most used web-based platforms for computational version control and collaboration, GitHub, and provide researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) with practical workflows to facilitate and improve their code and its management.

With over 73 million registered users as of 2022, GitHub is the most widely-used web platform for collaborating on computer code [@url:https://github.com/about].
GitHub provides a simple but powerful web interface that allows users to participate in projects, contribute code, report and discuss code bugs, discover existing code and data, and publish new code.
Through version control, users have a detailed, chronological record of the files and directories stored in their repositories[@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928] (see [Box 1](#definitions)).
This workflow provides a strong and clear advantage over sending files back-and-forth (_e.g._ via email), a process that can become challenging and time-consuming in long-term and collaborative projects [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
Through its combination of version control and collaborative features, GitHub facilitates open source code alongside collaborative development [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947].

Git is the version control system that enables all the collaborative tools available on GitHub.
Although the understanding of basic concepts of Git (such as commit, push, pull, checkout; see [Box 1](#definitions)) is necessary, the GitHub web-based platform and its integrated development environments (such as the GitHub Desktop) allow users to perform most repository and data management operations without opening Git command-line sessions.

The expansive GitHub user-community and numerous GitHub resources have boosted its popularity [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947; @doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928; @url:https://happygitwithr.com; @url:https://ourcodingclub.github.io].
Nevertheless, although multiple articles have encouraged researchers in EEB to adopt GitHub as part of their research process [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160; @doi:10.1038/538127a], its use is still not widespread.
First-time users without formal training in information technology may face steep learning curves because GitHub and its features have been centered on collaboration for code development in information systems [@doi:10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752419].
Moreover, domain-specific resources providing tractable examples and practical guidance for researchers in EEB on GitHub are scarce (but see <https://ourcodingclub.github.io>; <https://www.openscapes.org>).
Widespread adoption of GitHub for collaborating on research tasks can ultimately enable EEB researchers to spend less time on creating novel processes for collaboration and more time on their research [@doi:10.3897/rio.6.e56508].
More importantly, expanding the availability of data and code management standards -- of which GitHub is one increasingly important component -- makes research more reproducible and collaborative [@doi:10.1002/bes2.1801; @doi:10.31222/osf.io/gaj43].

This paper is the result of an academic hackathon held during the 2021 conference for the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE, <https://www.sortee.org>).
We convened a group of around thirty researchers in EEB with varying levels of familiarity with using GitHub as part of their research projects to showcase and discuss how existing features can contribute to documentation and collaboration in EEB research.
During the hackathon, we identified the need for a formal discussion on how EEB researchers can benefit from GitHub and its features.
Here, we outline twelve practical ways that EEB researchers can use GitHub features for more collaborative, transparent, and reproducible science.
We also provide critical perspectives on features that could be improved and catered towards research development.

| Glossary |
|---|
|**repository**: Commonly shortened to "repo", a repository is a collection of files (_e.g._, a directory) tracked by Git. Repositories are managed by an owner and can be listed as "public" where the repository will be visible to all GitHub users or "private", where the repository is visible only to authorized users. Repositories can be either "local" and saved on an individual's computer or "remote" and stored on the cloud via GitHub's web platform.|
|**fork**: A fork is a copy of a **repository** hosted on GitHub. If a repository is public, then anyone can make a fork. Even if they do not have access to **push** to the original repository, they can make a fork and edit it independently. Forks are linked to the original GitHub repository and "upstream" changes (_i.e._, those in the original repository) can be **merged** to keep the fork up to date with the original project. Changes made in the fork can be integrated into the original project via **pull requests**.|
|**clone**: Cloning a **repository** is a way of making a local copy (_i.e._, on your computer) of a GitHub **repository**. If you have access to **push** to a **repository**, this can be a first step to contributing to a project.|
|**branch**: Git workflow timelines or repositories are analogous to trees, with a main working project and diverging branches that are pointers to changes during the development process. A git branch is an alternative line of development for a project (**repository**). Branches allow users to add new features or modifications to the project without affecting the main part of the project. Development branches can be created at any point in time and work on each branch can continue independently. Branching is useful for testing out new ideas (both code and text) which may or may not eventually get integrated into the main branch of the project. Branches can also be used to isolate contributions of multiple contributors. Each person working on their own branch eliminates problems that may arise if conflicting edits are **pushed** to the same remote branch. Changes in a development branch can be **merged** into the main branch via **pull requests**. Branches can only be made by those who are given access to the project **repository**.|
|**commit**: Commits are snapshots of the development of a project. In Git, versions of files and directories are uniquely identified as "commits", allowing one to identify and track modifications line-by-line. Commits can include changes in multiple files and must include a brief commit message describing the changes made. A typical workflow is to make some related changes in files, add a commit message (_e.g._, "generate and include fig1 in results"), and after several commits **push** those commits to the remote (_i.e._, cloud-based) GitHub **repository**.|
|**push/pull**: When **commits** are made in a project locally, they must be synced with the remote GitHub repository by **pushing** them. Changes on a GitHub repository can then be **pulled** to keep your local version of the project up-to-date.|
|**pull request**: A pull request is a request that the owner(s) of a GitHub repository integrate changes you've made on either a **branch** in the repository or in your own **fork**. When you initiate a pull request, you must provide a description of what changes were made. Some automated tests may be run and review may be required before integrating your changes into the main **branch**.|
| **merge**: Combining **commits** from two different branches together into one **branch**|
|**release**: At any point a release can be made on GitHub to mark a significant milestone in the progression of a **repository**. While this GitHub feature is designed with releases of new versions of code in mind (_e.g._, v1.0.0), it can also be used to create a snapshot of a repository at significant stages like submission, revision, and acceptance of an associated manuscript.|
|**community**: A forum where GitHub users can ask for advice, offer solutions to questions, and share ideas (<https://github.community/>).|
