Most scientists, including ecologists and evolutionary biologists, depend on computational tools for their research [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Researchers write and use software packages or write code (hereafter, code) to perform scientific tasks ranging from data management, data analysis, and study replication, to the application and the development of tools for hypothesis testing.
Maintaining code for scientific collaboration requires an efficient and well-documented work-flow [@doi:10.1038/d41586-020-02462-7].
To facilitate this process, scientists have adopted software engineering tools, such as cloud-based services for documentation and version control [_e.g._, from the Google Suite, the Microsoft Suite, and GitHub [@doi:10.1038/538127a]].
However, most scientists lack exposure to coding practices and thus dedicate valuable time and effort to self-teaching these tools.
Because of this, researchers may not adhere to standards of code quality and maintenance [@doi:10.1145/2063348.2063374; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745; @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Here, we review and discuss the most popular platform for computational version control and collaboration, GitHub, and provide researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) with practical workflows to facilitate and improve their code and its management.

GitHub (<https://github.com>) provides a simple but powerful web interface that allows users to participate in projects by contributing, modifying and discussing existing code, reporting bugs, discovering code and data, and publishing new code.
Through version control, users have a detailed, chronological record of the files and directories stored in their repositories [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928] (see [Box 1](#definitions)).
This workflow provides a strong and clear advantage over sending files back-and-forth (_e.g._, via email), a process that can become challenging and time-consuming in long-term and collaborative projects [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
Through its combination of version control and collaborative features, GitHub facilitates open-source code alongside collaborative development [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947].

Git is the version control system that enables all the collaborative tools available on GitHub.
Git was originally developed as a fast, lightweight and open-source system that would allow software engineers to efficiently develop and collaborate in projects [@url:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git]. 
Since its launch in 2005, Git has become the leading version control system in software development and in other disciplines that similarly require collaboration and community contributions, such as scientific research [@doi:10.1109/MS.2012.61].
Although the understanding of basic concepts of Git (such as commit, push, pull, checkout; see [Box 1](#definitions)) is necessary, the GitHub web-based platform and its integrated development environments (such as GitHub Desktop) allow users to perform most repository and data management operations without opening Git command-line sessions, making these functionalities available to users who are less familiar with software development.

Version control involves tracking the state of the files in a folder, called a "repository" (see [Box 1](#definitions)), through the evolution of a project.
A basic workflow using git and GitHub is to 1) make changes to files in a repository on your computer, 2) record related changes in files as a "commit" (see [Box 1](#definitions)) along with a message describing the changes, 3) synchronize commits with GitHub (see "push" in [Box 1](#definitions)) so that the repository on the web is up to date. 
Collaborators can then view your changes online and synchronize them to their own computers (see "pull" in [Box 1](#definitions)).
Commits act like snapshots and one can view or even revert the state of the project to any previous commit.
If the modified files are plain text (e.g. computer code or .txt files), only the differences from the previous commit are recorded, allowing you to frequently commit changes without causing the size of the project to grow excessively.
This provides a safe and less cluttered alternative to frequently making full copies of documents at different points in their evolution (e.g. analysis.R, analasys_v2.R, analysis_FINAL.R).
More technical details about the use of Git and GitHub are beyond the scope of this paper (but see @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947, @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668, and @doi:10.1109/ICSE.2015.74).

The expansive GitHub user-community and numerous GitHub resources have boosted its popularity [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947; @doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928; <https://happygitwithr.com>; <https://ourcodingclub.github.io>].
Nevertheless, although multiple articles have encouraged researchers in EEB to adopt GitHub as part of their research process [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160; @doi:10.1038/538127a], its use is still not widespread.
First-time users without formal training in information technology may face steep learning curves because GitHub and its features have been centered on collaboration for code development in information systems [@doi:10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752419].
Also, field-specific resources providing tractable examples and practical guidance for researchers in EEB on GitHub are scarce [but see @doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13982; <https://ourcodingclub.github.io>; <https://www.openscapes.org>].
Widespread adoption of GitHub for collaborating on research tasks can ultimately enable EEB researchers to spend less time on creating novel processes for collaboration and more time on their research [@doi:10.3897/rio.6.e56508].
More importantly, expanding the availability of data and code management standards---of which GitHub is one increasingly important component---makes research more reproducible and collaborative [@doi:10.1002/bes2.1801; @doi:10.31222/osf.io/gaj43].

This paper is the result of an academic hackathon held during the 2021 conference for the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE, <https://www.sortee.org>).
We convened around thirty researchers in EEB with varying levels of familiarity with the usage of GitHub in research projects to showcase and discuss how existing features can contribute to documentation and collaboration in EEB research.
During the hackathon, we identified the need for formal discussions on how EEB researchers can benefit from GitHub and its features.
Here, we outline thirteen practical ways that EEB researchers can use GitHub features for more collaborative, transparent, and reproducible science.
We also provide critical perspectives on features that could be improved and catered towards research development.

| Glossary |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **repository**: A repository (commonly shortened to "repo") is a collection of files (*e.g.*, a directory) tracked by Git. Repositories are managed by an owner and can be made either "public", to be visible to all GitHub users, or "private", to selected owner-specified users. Repositories can be either "local" and saved on an individual's computer or "remote" and stored on the cloud via GitHub's web platform. |
| **fork**: A fork is a copy of a **repository** hosted on GitHub. If a repository is public, then anyone can make a fork. Even if they do not have access to **push** to the original repository, they can make a fork and edit it independently. Forks are linked to the original GitHub repository and "upstream" changes (*i.e.*, those in the original repository) can be **merged** to keep the fork up-to-date with the original project. Changes made in the fork can be integrated into the original project via **pull requests**. |
| **clone**: Cloning a **repository** is a way of making a local copy (*i.e.*, on your computer) of a GitHub **repository**. If you have access to **push** to a **repository**, this can be a first step to contributing to a project. |
| **branch**: Git workflow timelines or repositories are analogous to trees, with a main working project and diverging branches that are pointers to changes during the development process. A git branch is an alternative line of development for a project (repository). Branches allow users to add new features or modifications to the project without affecting the main part of the project. Development branches can be created at any point in time and work on each branch can continue independently. Branching is useful for testing out new ideas (both code and text) which may or may not eventually get integrated into the main branch of the project. Branches can also be used to isolate contributions of multiple contributors. Each person working on their own branch eliminates problems that may arise if conflicting edits are **pushed** to the same remote branch. Changes in a development branch can be **merged** into the main branch via **pull requests**. Branches can only be made by those who are given access to the project **repository**. |
| **commit**: Commits are snapshots of the development of a project. In Git, versions of files and directories are uniquely identified as "commits", allowing one to identify and track modifications line-by-line. Commits can include changes in multiple files and must include a brief commit message describing the changes made. A typical workflow is to make some related changes in files, add a commit message (*e.g.*, "Generate and include results figure"), and after several commits **push** those commits to the remote (*i.e.*, cloud-based) GitHub **repository**. |
| **push and pull**: When **commits** are made in a project locally, they must be synced with the remote GitHub repository by **pushing** them. Changes on a GitHub repository can then be **pulled** to keep your local version of the project up-to-date with the remote. |
| **pull request**: A pull request is a request for changes made on an individual's **branch** in the repository or in a user's **fork** to be merged to the repository. Pull requests contain a description of the changes alongside all code required for testing and review by other users prior to being merged into the repository. |
| **merge**: Combining **commits** from two different branches together into one **branch**. |
| **release**: At any point a release can be made on GitHub to mark a significant milestone in the progression of a **repository**. While this GitHub feature is designed with releases of new versions of code in mind (*e.g.*, v1.0.0), it can also be used to create a snapshot of a repository at significant stages like pre-print, submission, revision, and acceptance of an associated manuscript. |
| **community**: A forum where GitHub users can ask for advice, offer solutions to questions, and share ideas (<https://github.community/>). |
