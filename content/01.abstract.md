## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology are increasingly dependent on computational code to conduct research.
With the growing role of data science in research, the use of efficient methods to share, reproduce, and collaborate on code has become fundamental. 
GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers to track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and code.
Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub by researchers is limited due to the lack of domain-specific information and guidelines.
To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub in their own workflows, we review twelve practical ways to use the platform.
We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty from storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, to writing a manuscript.
Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration.
As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.
