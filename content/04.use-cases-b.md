Personal or laboratory websites can improve the sharing of research findings, build online presence, and increase coordination of research efforts [@doi:10.1038/nj7142-347a].
Despite researchers in ecology and evolution generally lacking experience in building or hosting webpages, many tools have been developed to help this process. 
Simple websites can consist of a single HTML or markdown document that will be rendered as a website by activating GitHub's Pages (<https://pages.github.com>) feature, allowing for the direct live hosting of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript files within a free github.io domain. 
More complex static websites can now be easily built from a series of markdown documents using a variety of software including literate programming tools like Quarto (<https://quarto.org>), and RMarkdown using R packages such as `distill` (<https://github.com/rstudio/distill>) and `blogdown` (<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown>).
The resulting files from static websites can then be hosted in repositories, from which one can activate GitHub's Pages (<https://pages.github.com>) feature.

Website templates are readily available on GitHub (<https://github.com/topics/website-template>) or in user-specific repositories, which can be forked ([Box 1](#definitions)) and customized [@isbn:9781491933503].
Aside from free hosting services, GitHub Pages also allows websites to be autogenerated and instantly updated following content modifications [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].
These methods of creating and hosting websites on GitHub pages lack a graphical user interface; however, free hosting, widely available template customization, and versioning are strong advantages over alternatives (*e.g.*, Wix, Weebly, Google Sites).

### Archiving citable code and data

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins, Dylan Gomes, PHPB*-->

Government, funding agencies, and publishers exercise rigorous open access data policies and mandates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0229003; @doi:10.1108/TG-03-2014-0008].
However, code and data sharing may be met by individual reluctance, temporary embargoes, or partially prevented by privacy and confidentiality reasons [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026828; @doi:10.3389/fpubh.2017.00327; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0134826].
Still, data deposition and ensuring its availability can amplify the outreach of published studies [@doi:10.7717/peerj.1242], increase citation rates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000308], and among many other reasons, enable the reproducibility and robustness of scientific advances [@doi:10.1038/ncb3506; @doi:10.1016/j.tree.2015.11.006; @doi:10.1038/533452a].
While public repositories on GitHub make it easy to store and share data files, they are not considered long-term repositories for research materials.
This is because GitHub, a for-profit company, does not have long-term data availability guarantees, allowing users to delete or make repositories private after publication.
Also, GitHub does not issue Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for content uploaded to their servers.
DOIs are persistent and citable unique alpha-numeric identifiers assigned to digitally stored research materials.
Because of this, scientists sharing code and data through GitHub are strongly encouraged to independently submit their research materials to long-term data archives (_e.g._, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, OSF [@doi:10.1038/538127a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947; @doi:10.1029/2021EA001797]; [Table 1](#tbl:compare)).
Some of these options (Zenodo, Figshare and OSF) integrate with GitHub, allowing project, code, and data releases ([Box 1](#definitions)) to be archived with versioned, citable DOIs.
Linking GitHub repositories with a DOI helps research become findable, properly cited, and can ensure long-term stability [@doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1].
This strategy has been increasingly adopted in numerous studies in ecology and evolution (_e.g._, the Zenodo repositores for @doi:10.5281/zenodo.6097109, @doi:10.5281/zenodo.3893943, and @doi:10.5281/zenodo.1188710).

An important aspect of making code and data citable and reusable is to add an appropriate license to protect intellectual property.
Code published without a license is under exclusive copyright (by default), protecting it from copy, distribution, and modifications.
One may grant specific rights to their code for reuse by adding licensing files and specifications within GitHub repositories [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository].
The Choose a License (<https://choosealicense.com/non-software/>) website offers further guidance on the licenses available for research and creative products.
For example, Creative Commons (CC; <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/>) licenses can specify that shared code is intended for a specific analysis.
A CC BY 4.0 license specifies that any code (or other creative products) must be appropriately credited to its original author when distributed, adapted or reused.


### Collaborative and asynchronous code editing

<!--*Contributors to this section: Kaitlyn Gaynor, Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Ali, Allison Binley*-->

<!-- I think I accidentally added more jargon, but I feel like this section is really important to get right. I'd be open to leaving all the GitHub jargon out and simply citing a source on this instead.  -->

In academic settings, GitHub can also facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, or among collaborators, providing a platform for everyone to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors, mentors, or collaborators ([Table 2](#tbl:roles)).
Periodic code review [@doi:10.1145/3341525.3387370] can also help identify errors early in the scientific process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills.
This is facilitated by a group of core features of git and GitHub that allow contributors to work simultaneously on the same project without interferring with eachother's work.
"Branching" and "forking" (see [Box 1](#definitions)) allow users to work independently on a linked copy of a repository and then later merge their changes into the main project. 
To signal that changes are ready to be merged, one makes a "pull request" (see [Box 1](#definitions)).
Pull requests are a formalized way of integrating changes to avoid conflicts that arise when users make simultaneous edits to the same parts of files [@doi:10.1007/s10664-019-09774-x]. 
The GitHub interface for a pull request allows collaborators to comment on specific lines of code/text being changed and even to provide suggestions that the pull request author can implement with the click of a button, greatly facilitating peer code review.
Moreover, version control [@https://sortee-github-hackathon.github.io/manuscript/v/latest/index.html#storing-and-archiving-version-controlled-data] allows researchers to make changes in code or documents without worrying about irreparably modifying someone else's work.
By enabling more comprehensive remote collaboration, GitHub encourages the exchange of ideas among researchers at different institutions and in different countries, which can serve to improve the quality of the research itself by providing open access to data and code.


### Writing a manuscript

<!--*contributors to this section:* Emma J. Hudgins, Katherine HÃ©bert-->

Beyond supporting collaborative code development, GitHub can be used for writing manuscripts.
Writing a manuscript and storing its associated data and code in GitHub increases scientific reproducibility because text, code, and data can be found in one place.
Writing a manuscript on GitHub may take more time when compared to using conventional text processors [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
Nevertheless, GitHub has many features that can allow for a powerful collaborative workflow when writing manuscripts.
Text documents stored and versioned in GitHub can be instantly displayed when written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language increasingly popular among scientists. Co-authors can contribute changes or suggest revisions to a manuscript written on GitHub through pull requests ([Box 1](#definitions)).
Pull requests provide line-by-line views of proposed changes, which can be commented, modified, or approved by designated reviewers and collaborators ([Table 2](#tbl:roles)).
Relevant literature or issues can be made using the Discussions and Issues features.
Moreover, real-time collaboration on text documents stored in GitHub repositories can be achieved with the help of other platforms [_e.g._, HackMD (<https://hackmd.io>) for Markdown documents]. 

Incorporating GitHub into the process of writing a manuscript does not necessarily mean pivoting to an entirely new workflow. 
For instance, authors who prefer writing in LaTeX can link their new or existing Overleaf projects to GitHub via the Git-Bridge and GitHub Synchronization features ([Table 1](#tbl:compare)), which are available through premium subscriptions to Overleaf or through many institutions worldwide via the Overleaf Commons service (<https://www.overleaf.com/for/universities>) [@url:https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_Git_and_GitHub]. 
Similar GitHub integrations are available for projects stored in DropBox, Google Drive, among other popular tools that are likely to be familiar to many scientists and their collaborators ([Table 1](#tbl:compare)).

We wrote this manuscript using Manubot [@url:manubot.org], a modifiable workflow implemented in GitHub to automatically render manuscripts and automate bibliographical tasks [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
Manubot uses GitHub's automation workflow, GitHub Actions, to combine and convert individual Markdown files into a single LaTeX document, which can then be converted to a Word or PDF document, and displayed as a webpage.
Citations and bibliographic references are automatically managed with citable persistent identifiers (_e.g._, DOIs, PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs).
The resulting manuscript can be rendered with document templates and citation style language formatting to meet journal formatting requirements.
Every change made to the manuscript triggers its rendering, so that updates are readily displayed and made publicly available.
Additional GitHub Actions can be integrated with Manubot, such as ones creating figures or generating tables (_e.g._, <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/tree/main/.github/workflows>).

### Peer review

<!--*contributors to this section:* Eric R. Scott-->

Peer review is the standard process for assessing and judging whether research done in ecology and evolution should be published in a scientific journal.
GitHub provides an open and transparent platform that can be used for either directly providing feedback on research products or addressing changes recommended by reviewers.
GitHub Issues can be used to organize and discuss reviewer suggestions and to assign them to co-authors (_e.g._, <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/issues?q=label%3A%22Reviewer+Comment%22+>).
When reviewer comments are posted as separate issues, authors can comment on the issues to discuss possible changes and assign themselves to indicate which comments they intend to handle.
Co-authors can then integrate their edits and responses to reviewers using pull requests.

GitHub can also assist reviewers during the peer review process.
If the code associated with a manuscript is made available at the time of submission (_e.g._, as a link to a GitHub repository within the Data Availability Statement), peer reviewers may be able to offer more comprehensive suggestions on the code and written materials, potentially recognizing errors before publication.
Certain journals or software development communities require submitted work or research code to be hosted on GitHub and their review processes make use of GitHub Issues (_e.g._, rOpenSci (<https://ropensci.org/software-review/>), Journal of Open Source Software (<https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html>)).
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including `rfishbase` [@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and `taxize` [@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].
