<!--## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 2)-->

### Hosting a website

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins*   -->
Personal or laboratory websites can improve the dissemination of research findings, build online presence and increase the coordination of research efforts [@doi:10.1038/nj7142-347a].
Despite many researchers in ecology and evolution having little experience in building or hosting webpages, many tools have been developed to help this process.
Static websites can now be easily built using independent software and languages, such as Jekyll (<https://jekyllrb.com>), Hugo (<https://gohugo.io>), Quarto (<https://quarto.org>) and wowchemy (<https://wowchemy.com>), or with the help of dependencies in the programming languages scientists commonly use, such as the `distill` (<https://github.com/rstudio/distill>) and `blogdown` (<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown>) R packages.
The resulting files from static websites can then be hosted in repositories, from which one can activate the GitHub Pages (<https://pages.github.com>) feature, allowing for the direct live hosting of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript files within a free github.io domain.
Website templates are readily available in GitHub (https://github.com/topics/website-template) or in user-specific repositories, which can be forked ([Box 1](#definitions)) and adapted to one's liking [@isbn:9781491933503].
Aside from free hosting services, GitHub Pages also allows websites to be autogenerated and instantly updated following content modifications [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].
Creating and hosting websites in GitHub pages can be often time-consuming, as this process usually requires more knowledge in web design than out-of-the-box platforms (*e.g.*, Wix, Weebly, Google Sites).
However, free hosting, widely available template customization and versioning are strong advantages over the alternatives.

### Archiving citable code and data

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins, Dylan Gomes, PHPB*-->

Nowadays, governmental, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers exercise rigorous open access data policies and mandates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0229003; @doi:10.1108/TG-03-2014-0008].
Although code and data sharing may be met by individual reluctance, temporary embargoes or partially prevented by privacy and confidentiality reasons [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026828; @doi:10.3389/fpubh.2017.00327; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0134826].
However, data deposition and ensuring its availability can amplify the outreach of published studies [@doi:10.7717/peerj.1242], increase citation rates [10.1371/journal.pone.0000308], and among many other reasons, enables the reproducibility and robustness of scientific advances [@doi:10.1038/ncb3506;@doi:10.1016/j.tree.2015.11.006; @doi:10.1038/533452a]. 
Most data-oriented publications are required to be accompanied by data availability statements, often requiring the data supporting their results to be readily available in public digital archives.
While public repositories in GitHub make it easy to store and share data files, they are not considered long-term repositories for research materials.
This because GitHub, a for-profit company, still does not have a clear wide long-term data availability guarantees, allowing users to delete or make repositories private after publication.
Also, GitHub does not issue Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for content uploaded to their servers.
DOIs are persistent and citable unique alpha-numeric identifiers assigned to digitally stored research materials.
Because of this, scientists sharing code and data through GitHub are strongly encouraged to independently submit their research materials to long-term data archives (_e.g._, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, OSF [@doi:10.1038/538127a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947; @doi:10.1029/2021EA001797; @tbl:compare].
Some of these options (Zenodo, Figshare and OSF) integrate with GitHub, allowing project, code and data releases ([Box 1](#definitions)) to be archived with versioned, citable DOI.
Linking GitHub repositories with a DOI helps research become findable, properly citated, and can ensure long-term stability [@doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1].

An important aspect of making code and data citable and reusable is to add an appropriate licence to protect for intellectual property.
Code published without a licence is under exclusive copyright (by default), protecting it from copy, distribution and modifications.
One may grant specific rights to their code for reusing by adding licensing files and specifications within GitHub repositories [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository].
The Choose a License (<https://choosealicense.com/non-software/>) website can offer further guidance on the potential licenses available for research and creative products.
For example, Creative Commons (CC; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licenses can be useful to specify that shared code is intended for a specific analysis.
A CC BY 4.0 license specifies that any code (or other creative products) must be appropriately credited to its original author when distributed, adapted or reused.
A GNU General Public License v3 provides the same attributions above, but prohibits requires all modified or adapted versions to be made public.

### Collaborative and asynchronous code editing

<!--*Contributors to this section: Kaitlyn Gaynor, Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Ali, Allison Binley*-->

Researchers can asynchronously communicate and individually or collaboratively work in GitHub.
By forking, branching and cloning repositories ([Box 1](#definitions)), researchers can simultaneously work on different issues of the same research project to then later merge changes to the main branch project with pull requests.
Explicit project organization and increased communication in GitHub Issues, Discussions or within pull requests can help with project development and with potential merge conflicts due to users simultaneously working in the same sections [@doi:10.1007/s10664-019-09774-x].
Moreover, version control [@https://sortee-github-hackathon.github.io/manuscript/v/latest/index.html#storing-and-archiving-version-controlled-data] and commit reversal features allow researchers to track and progress without worrying about irreparably modifying someone else's work.
By enabling more comprehensive remote collaboration, GitHub encourages the exchange of ideas among researchers at different institutions and in different countries, which can serve to improve the quality of the research itself by providing open access to data and code.
In academic settings, GitHub can also facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, providing a platform for students or other trainees to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors or mentors ([Table 1](#tbl:roles)).
Periodic code review [@doi:10.1145/3341525.3387370] can also help advisors identify errors early in the process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills.

### Writing a manuscript

<!--*contributors to this section:* Emma J. Hudgins-->

Beyond supporting collaboration code development, GitHub can be used for collaboratively writing manuscripts. 
Writing a manuscript and storing its associated data and code in GitHub increases scientific reproducibility because text, code, and data can be found in one place.
GitHub may not be as user-friendly for manuscript development as conventional text processors [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
Nevertheless, GitHub has many features that can allow for a powerful collaborative workflow when writing manuscripts.
Text documents stored and versioned in GitHub can be instantly displayed when written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language increasingly popular among scientists.
Co-authors can contribute changes or suggest revisions to a manuscript written in GitHub through pull requests ([Box 1](#definitions)).
Pull requests provide line-by-line views of proposed changes, which can be commented, modified or approved by designated reviewers and collaborators ([Table 1](#tbl:roles)).
Relevant literature or issues can be made using the Discussions and Issues features.
Moreover, real-time collaboration on text documents stored in GitHub repositories can be achieved with the help of other platforms (_e.g._, HackMD (<https://hackmd.io> for Markdown documents).

We wrote this manuscript using Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], a workflow implemented in GitHub to  automatically render manuscripts and automate bibliographical tasks.
Manubot uses GitHub's automation workflow, GitHub Actions, to combine and convert individual Markdown files containing prose into a single LaTeX document, which can then be converted to a Word or PDF document, and displayed in a webpage.
Citations and bibliographic references are automatically managed with citable persistent identifiers (_e.g._, DOIs, PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs).
The resulting manuscript can be rendered with document templates and citation style language formatting to meet journal formatting requirements.
Every change made to the manuscript triggers its rendering, so that updates are readily displayed and made publicly available.
Additional GitHub Actions automation workflows can be integrated with Manubot, such as ones creating figures or generating tables (_e.g._, https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/tree/main/.github/workflows).
For more examples manuscripts of Manubot being used, see [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

By using GitHub features, and tools combining Markdown and statistical programming languages [such as 
RMarkdown via the `bookdown` R package (<https://bookdown.org/>), Jupyter notebooks [@doi:10.1038/s42005-020-00403-4], Quarto (<https://quarto.org>)], scientists can adopt an unified dynamic and collaborative framework that allows prose and data analysis to be combined in centralized, versioned repository.

### Peer review

<!--*contributors to this section:* Eric R. Scott-->
Peer review is the standard process for assessing and judging whether research done in ecology and evolution should be published in a scientific journal.
GitHub provides an open and transparent platform that can be used for either directly providing feedback on research products or addressing changes recommended by reviewers.
GitHub Issues can be used to organize and discuss reviewer suggestions and to assign them to co-authors (_e.g._, <https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22reviewer+comment%22+>).
When reviewer comments are posted as separate issues, authors can comment on the issues to discuss possible changes and assign themselves to indicate which comments they intend to handle.
Co-authors can then integrate their edits and responses to reviewers using pull requests.
GitHub can also assist reviewers and authors during the peer review process.
If the code associated with a manuscript is made available at the time of submission (_e.g._, as a link to a GitHub repository within the Data Availability Statement), peer reviewers may be able to offer more comprehensive suggestions on the code and written materials, potentially recognizing errors before publication.
Certain journals or software development communities require submitted work or research code to be hosted on GitHub and their review processes make use of GitHub Issues [_e.g._, rOpenSci (<https://ropensci.org/software-review/>); Journal of Open Source Software (<https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html>)].
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including `rfishbase` [@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and `taxize` [@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].
