<!--## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 2)-->

### Creating a website

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins*   -->
Personal or laboratory websites can improve the dissemination of research findings, build online presence and increase the coordination of research efforts [@doi:10.1038/nj7142-347a].
Despite many researchers in ecology and evolution having little experience in building or hosting webpages, many tools have been developed to help this process.
Static websites can now be easily built using independent software and languages, such as Jekyll (<https://jekyllrb.com>), Hugo (<https://gohugo.io>), Quarto (<https://quarto.org>) and wowchemy (<https://wowchemy.com>), or with the help of dependencies in the programming languages scientists commonly use, such as the `distill` (<https://github.com/rstudio/distill>) and `blogdown` (<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown>) R packages.
The resulting files from static websites can then be hosted in repositories, from which one can activate the GitHub Pages (<https://pages.github.com>) feature, allowing for the direct live hosting of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript files within a free github.io domain.
Website templates are readily available in GitHub (https://github.com/topics/website-template) or in user-specific repositories, which can be forked ([Box 1](#definitions)) and adapted to one's liking [@isbn:9781491933503].
Aside from free hosting services, GitHub Pages also allows websites to be autogenerated and instantly updated following content modifications [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].
Creating and hosting websites in GitHub pages can be often time-consuming, as this process usually requires more knowledge in web design than out-of-the-box or what-you-see-is-what-you-get platforms (*e.g.*, Wix, Weebly, Google Sites).
However, free hosting, widely available template customization and versioning are strong advantages over the alternatives.

### Archiving citable code and data

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins, Dylan Gomes*-->

Nowadays, governmental, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers exercise rigorous open access data policies and mandates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0229003; @doi:10.1108/TG-03-2014-0008].
Although code and data sharing may be met by individual reluctance, temporary embargoes or partially prevented by privacy and confidentiality reasons [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026828; @doi:10.3389/fpubh.2017.00327; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0134826].
However, data deposition and ensuring its availability can amplify the outreach of published studies [@doi:10.7717/peerj.1242], increase citation rates [10.1371/journal.pone.0000308], and among many other reasons, enables the reproducibility and robustness of scientific advances [@doi:10.1038/ncb3506;@doi:10.1016/j.tree.2015.11.006; @doi:10.1038/533452a]. 
Most data-oriented publications are required to be accompanied by data availability statements, often requiring the data supporting their results to be readily available in public digital archives.
While public repositories in GitHub make it easy to store and share data files, they are not considered long-term repositories for research materials.
This because GitHub, a for-profit company, still does not have a clear wide long-term data availability guarantees, allowing users to delete or make repositories private after publication.
Also, GitHub does not issue Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for content uploaded to their servers.
DOIs are persistent and citable unique alpha-numeric identifiers assigned to digitally stored research materials.
Because of this, scientists sharing code and data through GitHub are strongly encouraged to independently submit their research materials to long-term data archives (_e.g._, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, OSF [@doi:10.1038/538127a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947; @doi:10.1029/2021EA001797; @tbl:compare].
Some of these options (Zenodo, Figshare and OSF) integrate with GitHub, allowing project, code and data releases ([Box 1](#definitions)) to be archived with versioned, citable DOI.
Linking GitHub repositories with a DOI helps research become findable, properly citated, and can ensure long-term stability [@doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1].

An important aspect of making code and data citable and reusable is adding an appropriate licence.
Code published without a licence is under exclusive copyright (by default), protecting it from copy, distribution and modifications.
One may grant specific rights to one's code for reusing by adding licensing files and specifications within repositories.
For example, Creative Commons (CC; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licenses can be useful to specify that shared code is intended for a specific analysis.
A CC BY 4.0 license specifies that any code (or other creative products) must be appropriately credited to its original author when distributed, adapted or reused.
A GNU General Public License v3 provides the same attributions above, but prohibits requires all modified or adapted versions to be made public.
The Choose a License (<https://choosealicense.com/non-software/>) website can offer further guidance on the potential licenses available for research and creative products.

### Collaborative (code) editing and asynchronous working

<!--*Contributors to this section: Kaitlyn Gaynor, Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Ali, Allison Binley*-->

GitHub facilitates collaborative coding and asynchronous working because researchers can seamlessly access and contribute to data and code regardless of disparities in schedules or location. 
Project work can also be clearly split among team members, giving them the flexibility to contribute when it best fits their schedule. 
We acknowledge that there are important differences between the average software developer and EEB researcher using GitHub, and that not all of GitHub's features are useful for research workflows ([Table 1](#tbl:roles)).
However, git's core features such as forking and branching ([Box 1](#definitions)) allow for simultaneous coding on different versions of the same research project, and alternative versions can be discussed and resolved with GitHub.
When EEB projects are contained on the GitHub platform, researchers can stay abreast of progress made by other collaborators without the need for meetings or emails.
Version control [@https://sortee-github-hackathon.github.io/manuscript/v/latest/index.html#storing-and-archiving-version-controlled-data] features also allow users to make progress and changes without worrying about irreparably writing over someone else's work.
By enabling more comprehensive remote collaboration, GitHub encourages the exchange of ideas among researchers at different institutions and in different countries, which can serve to improve the quality of the research itself by providing open access to data and code.
In academic settings, GitHub can also facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, providing a platform for students or other trainees to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors or mentors.
Periodic code review [@doi:10.1145/3341525.3387370] can also help advisors identify errors early in the process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills.

### Writing a manuscript

<!--*contributors to this section:* Emma J. Hudgins-->

Beyond supporting collaboration at the level of code, GitHub can be used for collaboratively writing manuscripts. 
Writing a manuscript in GitHub and storing it with associated data and code all in the same repository increases scientific reproducibility because files associated with a manuscript can be found in one place.
Co-authors can contribute new text to a manuscript or suggest revisions through GitHub's robust pull request feature ([Box 1](#definitions)) which provides a line-by-line view of all proposed changes.
Further, authors can make use of the Discussions tab to suggest relevant papers to be cited, and can raise issues during the writing process that can be assigned to collaborators ([Table 1](#tbl:roles)).

While GitHub is not considered as user-friendly for manuscript development as conventional text processors [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7], it has been substantially improved with recent tools.
Manuscripts can be written on GitHub with Markdown.
Add-ons like HackMD (<https://hackmd.io>), can enable real-time collaboration for individual Markdown documents.
Many tools exist for extending Markdown and Pandoc to add formatting features necessary for scientific writing like in-text citations and figure and table cross references.

We wrote this manuscript using Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], a collaborative manuscript platform that uses Markdown for writing and GitHub for storing and tracking changes to a manuscript over time.
Manubot uses a GitHub Actions-based typesetting system to compile individual Markdown files stored in a GitHub repository into a single LaTeX document, which can be displayed in Word, HTML, or PDF formats.
The resulting manuscript can also be compiled using a journal's .tex template to match their formatting requirements.
Since this tool reruns the entire manuscript compilation process with any change to the underlying repository, it can also accomodate continuous integration of code updates into figures and tables with additional GitHub Actions (e.g. https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/tree/main/.github/workflows).
Manubot also allows for straightforward citation management based on URLs or DOIs. 
For more examples of Manubot being used for manuscripts, see [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

Since Manubot works on documents in a distributed format, it can be difficult to edit manuscripts for overall flow with only this tool.
We employed hypothes.is (<https://hypothes.is>) to write comments on the HTML manuscript document produced by Manubot, which we then addressed by committing changes to the underlying Markdown files via pull requests.
Other authors can reply to the comments to indicate agreement or disagreement, and to note when changes have been made.
Other tools can also be used for version control of scientific manuscripts including R Markdown via the bookdown package (<https://bookdown.org/>), jupyter notebooks [@doi:10.1038/s42005-020-00403-4] and a relatively new tool, Quarto (<https://quarto.org>).

### Peer-Review

<!--*contributors to this section:* Eric R. Scott-->
Peer review plays a critical role in the scientific evaluation of EEB research.
GitHub provides an open and transparent platform that can be used for either directly providing feedback on research products or building a to-do list from reviewer comments.
Peer review of research code by the open software development community rOpenSci (<https://ropensci.org/software-review/>) and of research software and associated manuscripts by the Journal of Open Source Software (<https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html>) requires that submitted work is hosted on GitHub and their review processes make use of GitHub issues.
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including rfishbase [@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and taxize [@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].  

GitHub can also be used as a hub for reviewers and authors during the peer review process of an ordinary research manuscript.
If the code associated with a manuscript is made available at the time of submission (e.g. via a link to a GitHub repository in a Data Availability Statement), peer-reviewers may be able to offer more helpful suggestions on written methods and may even make comments on the code itself, potentially catching bugs or errors before publication.
GitHub can also be used as a hub for reviewers and authors during the peer review process of an ordinary research manuscript.
GitHub issues can be used to organize and discuss reviewer suggestions and to assign them to co-authors (See example in <https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22reviewer+comment%22+>).
When reviewer comments are posted as separate issues, authors can comment on the issues to discuss possible changes and assign themselves to indicate which comments they intend to handle.
Co-authors can then integrate their edits and responses to reviewers using pull requests.
