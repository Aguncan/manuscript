### The promise of GitHub for EEB researchers

There have been many calls for researchers outside of the software development community to adopt GitHub to improve their collaborative research [@doi:10.1029/2021ea001797; @doi:10.1111/tgis.12810; @doi:10.1038/538127a].
These calls come in light of the continuous shift towards open-science and the increasing computational and data requirements in EEB.
Until now, resources and practical guidance on using GitHub within the EEB community have been dispersed in blog posts and video tutorials ([Box 2](#tips)).
These resources have been useful for learning to use GitHub in our own work.
We expect that situating the main uses of GitHub in EEB into one medium, while adding on our personal perspectives, will be useful to the EEB community.

The thirteen use cases we described here can leverage GitHub to enable more transparent and collaborative research in ecology and evolution (Figure @fig:scatterblob).
Most of these uses can be quickly integrated into the research practices of users (_e.g._, storing data, creating virtual notebooks, making code citable).
Making stored data and code citable usually involves creating a repository on GitHub, pushing code and data, and then integrating a DOI minting service to the repository (_e.g._, with Zenodo; see below).
On the other hand, some examples we described here, including course material development, web hosting, and automation, require greater effort and time commitment, but have the potential to make EEB research more open, accessible, and collaborative.
Managing full research projects or laboratories on GitHub require careful thought as to how to delegate tasks such as reviewing pull requests or creating issues.
For example, collaboratively authoring a paper using GitHub, as we have done here, involves a learning curve for co-authors less familiar with the intricacies of GitHub, requires overhead to set up the automation framework through GitHub Actions, and especially, the commitment from all co-authors to use GitHub when modifying and reviewing the text.
Despite the potential applications of GitHub to EEB research, we acknowledge that researchers might still look to other platforms for research collaboration.

### Other platforms for collaboration

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob*-->

Despite its strong collaborative potential, we describe two use cases where GitHub's features fall short of highly collaborative work emblematic of EEB research.

First, real-time document editing is still best performed on other platforms (_e.g._, cloud-stored documents from Microsoft Word, Google Docs, hackMD (<https://hackmd.io/>)).
Second, operations that are dependent on other software might not be easily achievable in GitHub, such as manipulating figures or tables.
Although creating tables and figures can be done through code, users may choose other software to collaboratively brainstorm figures and tables (_e.g_., Google Slides, Google Sheets; but see GitHub Discussions).

### Why aren't more EEB researchers using GitHub?

<!--*Contributors to this section: Saeed, Vivienne, PHPB*-->

Although GitHub has been available as a platform for more than a decade, its uptake among EEB researchers, especially as a tool for collaboration, has been slow. Here, we discuss five potential barriers to GitHub use in EEB:

First, there may be hesitation to independently adopting and learning a new tool. 
Institutional encouragement and instructional resources focused on researchers in ecology and evolution may be limited.
When GitHub is taught within an EEB context, it usually accompanies coursework in topics such as statistical programming.
It can be challenging to learn Git alongside scripting languages, statistical theory, and file system navigation, especially when many prospective users may be inexperienced with programming.
Instructors likewise may confuse the expected digital literacy of students with computational fluency, even when modern technology increasingly abstracts concepts through search optimization and preponderant integrated development environments (IDE), or 'point-and-click' user interfaces.

Second, while EEB researchers individually use GitHub, collaborative use may lag due to researchers traditionally dividing labor within projects.
Despite broad utility, GitHub remains a tool predominantly used by computer scientists and software developers. 
EEB researchers may take the view that GitHub is a platform that only needs to be used by individuals writing code and may silo those aspects of projects to a single individual.
Those assumptions may obscure the utility of GitHub for tasks other than traditional data analysis and code development.
However, we emphasize that there are opportunities for collaboration using GitHub by researchers of all skill levels or time constraints ([Table 2](#tbl:roles)); for example, project stakeholders can provide a list of use-cases or highlight important conceptual components of a project using GitHub Issues or Discussions features.

A third barrier may come from general reluctance to share data and code publicly, or technical and logistical issues [@doi:10.31222/osf.io/gaj43].
GitHub is, by default, a public and open platform.
This openness may add additional pressure to students and scientists learning to use the platform.
Moreover, additional tools may be required to fully integrate project files and GitHub repositories (_e.g._, [@url:https://help.osf.io/article/211-connect-github-to-a-project]).

A fourth additional barrier to EEB researchers is the lack language-specific resources for non-English speaking researchers working in ecology and evolution.
Language is a well-known obstacle to international collaborative research progress and to widespread scientific knowledge [see @doi:10.1016/j.tree.2021.11.003].
Non-English speaking EEB researchers can potentially miss opportunities to fully integrate version control, reproducibility, and other benefits of GitHub without language-inclusive contents.

Fifth and lastly, when projects become highly collaborative, they may have to pay for GitHub features such as branch protections, multiple reviewers of pull requests, and time in its automation tools.
Currently, GitHub offers Education Packs (<https://education.github.com/>) to students and academics, which extend some paid features to the free plan.
However, the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft has raised concerns over the future of free plans, causing several biodiversity data managers to shift to alternative Open Source Git services (_e.g._, Bitbucket and GitLab).

### Box 2 {#tips}

| Ten tips for getting started in GitHub |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **Check for existing solutions to your problem.** The GitHub Help webpage (<https://docs.github.com/en>) contains extensive and detailed documents with helpful screenshots. It is a good starting point for handling an issue, and has troubleshooting tips for specific problems. Alternatively, consider Tweeting your issue. There is a large community of GitHub users around the world who have likely faced analogous problems and may be able to provide quick solutions. Third, try to follow blogs (_e.g._, <https://github.blog>), Twitter accounts or YouTube channels that regularly post practical solutions about the most widely-used web platform for common GitHub issues. |
| 2. **Consider taking free courses**, such as those from Software Carpentry [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3264950], and sharing these courses with your lab members or colleagues. |
| 3. **Take advantage of GitHub as an asynchronous working tool for team-based projects.** See the repository for this paper (<https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript>) as an example of a collaboratively authored manuscript that used the GitHub Discussions, Issues, Pages, and Actions features. |
| 4. **Use the interactive courses from the GitHub Skills page (<https://skills.github.com/>)**, which allow you to learn GitHub basics through short projects and tasks with step-by-step guides. |
| 5. **Learn markdown and use cheatsheets (_e.g._, <http://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax>)** so you can write clear metadata README files for your repositories. |
| 6. **Consult online resources.** The Jenny Bryan Universe of GitHub material, for example, provides a thorough and accessible introduction for a multitude of research-related uses for GitHub, and includes a book [@http://happygitwithr.com], statistics course [@http://stat545.com] and academic article [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928]. |
| 7. **Do not be afraid of trial-and-error.** One of the best ways to learn GitHub is the "trial-and-error" method. Learning from your own mistakes can be a valuable way to master your GitHub abilities. In any case, if you make mistakes, GitHub allows you to revert any steps that you desire via version controlling. |
| 8. **If you are an educator, include lectures on reproducibility and tools for creating reproducible workflows in the curricula.** Some graduate programs include coursework on course R Markdown and GitHub. Getting students started with these tools earlier will prevent the resistance that comes from working with a less reproducible workflow for a longer period of time (see example <https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022>). |
| 9. **Try to begin committing with graphical user interfaces (GUI) instead of command line interfaces (CLI).** Examples of GUI are the GitHub Desktop (<https://desktop.github.com>), git-gui (<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui>), RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com>), Visual Studio Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com>), Atom (<https://atom.io>), GitKraken (<https://www.gitkraken.com>).
| 10. **Get help deciphering GitHub Notifications.** Try using tools like Octobox (<https://octobox.io>) to disentangle and manage multiple notifications from distinct GitHub projects. |
