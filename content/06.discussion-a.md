<!-- ### General paragraph on what GitHub can enable in EcoEvo  
*Contributors to this section: Rob, Brandon*   -->

There have been many calls for researchers outside of the software development community to leverage GitHub for their collaborative research.  
These calls come in light of the continual shift toward science that is more open as well as computationally and data intensive.  
Until now, resources and practical guidance specifically focused on using GitHub within the EEB community have been dispersed in blog posts and video tutorials.  
While these resources have been extremely useful for learning to use GitHub, we provide a more comprehensive review of the key benefits that GitHub can bring to EEB researchers regardless of career stage or coding experience.  

In this paper, we describe 13 tractable ways that EEB researchers can leverage GitHub to enable more transparent and collaborative research (Figure 2).  
Many of the examples are specifically meant for first-time GitHub users and can likely be adopted with just several hours of practice (e.g., storing data, creating virtual notebooks, making code citable).  
For example, storing code and data and making it citable simply involves creating a repository on Github, pushing code to the repository, and then going through several quick steps to create a DOI for the repository.   
Even with time necessary to learn some GitHub and version control basics, we emphasize that these are transferrable skills that can help students and postdocs be successful in academia or industry.  

Other more advanced examples in this paper may require a greater time commitment, but have the potential to make EEB research even more open, accessible, and collaborative than ever before.  
For example, managing full research projects or research labs on GitHub will require careful thought as to how to delegate tasks such as reviewing pull requests or creating issues.  
Additionally, collaboratively writing a manuscript using GitHub, as we have done here, involves an entire team to be engaged in more advanced GitHub processes like using GitHub actions and reviewing pull requests.   
Despite the many potential applications of GitHub to EEB research, we acknowledge that there will still be many times when researchers might look to other platforms for research collaboration.  

### Limitations to using GitHub for research collaboration
<!-- *Contributors to this section: Rob*, Ali --> 
Though we see GitHub as a useful tool for collaboration in EEB, we describe 2 use cases where, to our knowledge, GitHub's features still fall short of those necessary for highly collaborative EEB research (Table 2).  
First, because of the underlying version control system which tracks "pushed" changes through "commits", real-time collaborative editing (e.g., as on a shared Google Doc or Word document stored on Dropbox) is not possible on GitHub.  
There are now websites that are built on top of the GitHub architecture that allow real-time collaborative editing on a document that can then be pushed to GitHub (e.g., [hackMD](https://hackmd.io/).  
We used HackMD at two key points in writing our manuscript when real-time co-writing was essential: when taking meeting notes and writing the outline of our paper.   
Second, we looked to other software when working on figures and tables.  
Though creating tables and figures on GitHub using markdown or other scripting languages is possible, we found that it was not practical at the early brainstorming stages.
We needed to rapidly iterate on figure and table design, share feedback through comments, and merge/reorder ideas when necessary.
For these reasons, we used Google Slides for working on figures and Google Sheets for working on tables.
As our figures and tables moved toward more finalized forms, some co-authors chose to create the tables and figures using R and Markdown which could then be tracked using the same version control system as the rest of manuscript.

There are also more logistical constraints to using GitHub in research workflows.  
Due to some file size limitations imposed by GitHub it can be difficult to synch large files to GitHub repos.  
One way around this issue is to attach additional large files to the repository release once code in the repository is ready for use.  
Another limitation is the lack of GitHub help documents for non-English researchers in EEB that may lead them to miss the opportunity to fully understand the importance version control as well as the other benefits of GitHub.  
Lastly, GitHub is owned by a private company (microsoft) and though the platform hosts an immense amount of open source code, researchers should also consider archiving research materials in long-term data and code repositories.  

### Why aren't more EEB researchers using GitHub?

Though GitHub has been available as a platform for more than a decade at time of writing, its uptake among EEB researchers, especially as a tool for collaboration, has been slow.  
Some research groups choose to take advantage of alternative platforms with similar capabilities, such as GitLab or Bitbucket, but many have yet to integrate these types of project management software into their lab ecosystems at all.  
Some attribute this hesitation to the steep learning curve combined with limited instruction available through traditional university courses.  
When use of GitHub is taught within an EEB context, it is usually accompanying coursework in topics such as statistical programming, and some students may find it overwhelming to juggle learning git alongside scripting languages, statistical theory, and file system navigation, especially when many may also be new to using command-line interfaces in general.  
Instructors likewise may confuse the expected digital literacy of younger students with computational fluency, even when modern technology increasingly abstracts many relevant concepts through search optimization and preponderant IDEs.  
The default public nature of GitHub usage can add additional pressure to students learning to use the platform (Gomes et al. In Prep).   
Thus, hesitancy may come from a more general reluctance to share data and code publicly [@doi:10.1038/s41597-021-00981-0], or technical and logistical issues related to storage of large data files and lack of integration with other research platforms.  

While many quantitative EEB researchers may take advantage of GitHub for individual use, collaborative use may lag behind due to how researchers traditionally divide labor within projects.  
GitHub remains a tool predominantly used by computer scientists and software developers, and EEB researchers may view GitHub as a platform that only needs to be used by individuals writing code.      
Those assumptions may have obscured the utility of GitHub for tasks other than traditional data analysis and software development, or how GitHub can facilitate the integration of code with non-coding aspects of projects through the practice of repository design.

| 10 Tips for getting started in GitHub |
|---|
| 1. **Check for an existing solution to your problem** The GitHub Help [webpage](https://docs.github.com/en) contains extensive and detailed documents with helpful screenshots. It is a good starting point for handling an issue, and has troubleshooting tips for specific problems. Alternatively, consider Tweeting your issue. There is a large community of GitHub users around the world who have likely faced analogous problems and may be able to provide quick solutions. Third, try to follow blogs e.g.(https://github.blog/), Twitter accounts or YouTube channels that regularly post practical solutions about common GitHub issues. |
| 2- **Consider taking free courses** such as those from [Software Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and sharing these courses with your lab members or colleagues.|
| 3. **Take the advantage of GitHub as an asynchronous working tool for team-based projects** See the repository for [this paper](https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/) as an example of a collaborative manuscript that includes discussions, issues, and a website via GitHub. |
| 4. **The GitHub [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)** allows you to learn GitHub basics through short projects and tasks, and allows you to get feedback from their Learning Lab bot.|
| 5. **Check out the following [markdown cheatsheet](http://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)** so that you can write clear metadata README files for your repositories.| 
| 6. **The Jenny Bryan universe of GitHub material** provides a thorough and accessible introduction for a multitude of research-related uses for GitHub, and includes a [book](http://happygitwithr.com), [statistics course](http://stat545.com/) and [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928]. |
| 7. **Don't be afraid of trial and error** One of the best ways to learn Github is the trial and error method. Learning from your own mistakes can be the better way to master your GitHub abilities. In any case, GitHub has the advantage of making it easy to go back to any steps that you desire via version controlling if you make mistakes. |
| 8. **If you are an educator, include lectures on reproducibility and tools for creating reproducible workflows in your curricula**. Some graduate programs now include coursework on course Rmarkdown and GitHub. Getting students started with these tools earlier will prevent the resistance that comes from working with a less reproducible workflow for a longer period of time. |
| 9. **Try to begin committing with GUI (Graphical user interface) tools** like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [git-gui](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) tools instead CLI (Command line interface) tools such as Terminal or Console for more advanced features.
| 10. **Get help deciphering GitHub Notifications.** Try using tools like [Octobox](https://octobox.io/) to disentangle and manage multiple notifications from distinct GitHub projects. |
